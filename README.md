# CodinGame Puzzle Solutions :game_die: :blue_heart:

## Description

This project contains solutions for various puzzles from CodinGame. It's intended for anyone who wants to learn, compare their solutions, or just needs a little help getting through a tough puzzle.

(The main languages I'm learning is Python and C, so most of them would be solved in some of those two or in both)
